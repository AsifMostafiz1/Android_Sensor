This based on an android project in this project working on four types of sensor Light sesnor, Proximity sensor, Accumulator sessor and gyroscope sensor. This app will show all the current values of this four sensor on the screen and aslo save the value in Sqlite local database in every five munites, if the user click any type of sensor then it it will show you all the values that is stored in database.

By doing that project i have to know all of the sessor that uses in android phones.
